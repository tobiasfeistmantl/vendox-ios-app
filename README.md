# Vendox iOS/Swift App

I built Vendox as a side project and for learning purposes. It's basicly a location based product search engine.

[It uses Rails as a backend](https://github.com/tobiasfeistmantl/vendox-cloud).

Feel free to take the code and learn from my failures!

Found an issue (and there are probably a lot of them)? Then report them.
